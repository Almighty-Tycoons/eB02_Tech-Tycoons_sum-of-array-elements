#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative assessment 

<u> <b>Description: </b>
    During the experiment, students will perform tasks on the basis of instructions given previously, and simulator will execute code line by line. In simulator when the user inputs the values which is to be defined and if the value is incorrect then virtual simulator will display an alert message. After the execution of the program, user expects some predefined result.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Describe array | User will declare <br>array indexes  | Q.1-An array index starts with.?<br> A) -1 <br><b>B) 0 </b><br> C) 1 <br> D) 2
2.| User will be able to: <br>Recall to assign values to array indexes |User will input <br> values at every index | Q.1- Correct declarartion of the array is?<br> A) data_type array_name[int];<br><b>B) data_type array_name[size]; </b><br> C) 10 a[int]; <br> D) array_name[subscript];
3.| User will be able to <br> understand concept of for loop | User will perceive<br>Through entire program  | Q.1 -Choose a correct C statement regarding for loop.<br> <b>A) for( ; ; )</b><br>B) for( ); </b><br> C) for(int:condition:i++) <br> D) None of these 
4.| User will be able to <br>Apply formula to get the sum of the array elements.| User will apply<br> formula to find sum of array elements| Q.1- What will be the sum of array elements of the following array? <br>int[] ar = {2, 4, 6, 8 } <br> A) -20 <br><b>B) 20 </b><br> C) 18 <br> D) 19

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will start the simulator  | Simulator will ask number of index that student wants  |In C programming we have to define size of array at initial point so always ask number of indexes that student needs.
2.| Student will input number of indexes<br>then press <b>OK</b> | Simulator will show input boxes for student to enter values on indexes  | Since the size of array is large so to make sure student should not confuse only the number of text boxes will be shown.
3.| Student will input values to textboxes<br> then press <b>OK</b> | Simulator will start executing and store values to the indexes they are assigned  |In array address are continuous so this step visualise this concept.
4.| Student will <br> press <b>next</b> button until the program termintes | Simulator will execute each line one by one and print the output.  |Every student gets the logic but they are confused how these things actually work so we visualize the entire process which makes learning smoother.
